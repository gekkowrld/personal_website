		<h1>My Childhood</h1>
		<p>My journey through childhood has been a fascinating exploration of diverse interests. Initially drawn to the allure of the medical field (<i>a passion that still resonates with me</i>), my world expanded in 2018 when I stumbled upon the captivating realm of computers.</p>
		<i>Reflecting on my early years, I realize I grew up school-hopping, a unique experience that exposed me to various perspectives and helped shape my life's trajectory.</i>
		<p>Interacting with different people along the way provided invaluable guidance, and one quote that particularly resonates with me is:</p>
		<q>"As long as it feels good, do it."</q>
		<p>Among the myriad of memories from my childhood, one stands out vividly - the time when I excelled in primary school, emerging as the best student in my class.</p>
		<p>These formative experiences have left an indelible mark on my character, influencing my interests and aspirations.</p>
